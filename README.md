How to use our product!

**Setup**
1. You will want to ideally gather some cardboard boxes to form a rectuangular bin structure. You can use anything here, however we will be poking holes in it so we found
carboard to be the easiest here. Save some cardboard for future steps. Make it so that there is no lid for now
2. cut some extra pieces of cardboard to form a small rectangular base. you should make 5 of these. 
3. Cut 2 smaller sized holes into the middle-top portion of the bin. They should be around a half inch below where the lid will be. 
4. Using zipties, mount the arduino ultrasonic distance sensor onto one of the rectangular bases you cut in step 2. Mount this to the bin by putting the zipties through the hole so that
the sensor is facing outwards of the bin. This is the front of your trash bin.
5. Now, using another piece of cardboard, cut a medium sized lever-shaped piece out. This will be attached to the servo motor to lift the lid of the bin from the inside. Cut two holes
in this piece so that you can attach it to the bin with your zipties
6. Now, in the back of the bin, cut out two more holes and attach the lid of the bin using the piece from the previous step
7. You are going to now attach the lever piece to the servo motor. After it is attached to the servo motor, cut out two more holes in the back of the trash bin. Make sure that they are
high enough so that when the lever is attached, as it rotates upward it will push open the lid
8. Attach the lever using zipties, make sure it is going across the top of the inside of the trash bin
9. You will now want to attach 4 Arduino IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor. Start by putting two more holes right below where you put the lever and attach 1 sensor using those holes.
Make sure as you attach the sensors, they are facing towards the inside of the bin.
10. Repeat step 9, placing a sensor on each side of the bin (left, right, front) all at the same height as you placed the first. This is your "capacity line".
11. Follow the circuit diagram attached to ensure correct wiring of the rt embedded system
